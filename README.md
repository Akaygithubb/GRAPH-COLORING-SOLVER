# Graph Coloring Project

This project implements a graph coloring algorithm using Python. The goal is to color the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

## Features

- Add edges to the graph
- Choose the number of colors
- Visualize the graph and its coloring

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `networkx` library
- `matplotlib` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-coloring-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd graph-coloring-project
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python graph_coloring.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter the number of colors for the graph coloring algorithm.

### Example

Enter the number of colors: `3`

The graph will be visualized using matplotlib with different colors for each node.

## Visualization

The graph will be visualized using `matplotlib`, with different colors representing different nodes.
